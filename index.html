What is a dog? Dogs are the eyes and ears for the blind and deaf. They are therapy for the shut-ins and disabled and can be a best buddy for a ten year old. Dogs will comfort and soothe an elderly widow or pull sleds loaded with medicine through snow and ice. They perform search and rescue when avalanches bury people and towns and can hunt and track lost hikers, locate missing bodies and find babies buried in the rubble of fallen buildings. Dogs can sniff out illegal drugs and bombs buried in hiding places. They track the worst of criminals and help fight wars as well as guarding you, your kids and your property to the death.</p>

<section id="why" class="why">
	<h1> Why do we love them?</h1>
  <div>It has a scientific explanation; When humans and dogs look into each other’s eyes, both get a boost of the feel-good hormone oxytocin, which is the same hormone behind the special bond between new parents and their babies.</div>

	Nothing beats a long walk with your four-legged friend on a fresh, spring morning. Or seeing the joy on their faces when you pick up a ball and they know it’s playtime in the local park! Even relaxing at home feels better in each other’s company.

There’s an old saying, which is certainly true, that pets and dogs repay the love you give them ten-fold.

Before you rush out and get a dog, it’s important to think it through very thoroughly. It can be hard work and it’s a lifetime commitment, as your dog will be relying on you for many years to come.

	<div> Dogs could become you're best friend, they will always be there to play with you, hear you (even if they can´t give you an answer).</div>
